# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Summary

This file repo is to demonstrate use of mapbox and GeoJSON data from multiple sources to create a visualization showing earthquake information for the last week in an easy to understand format.

## Purpose

Pulling information from USGS, this repository shows earthquake data from the last week and overlays approximate tectonic plate locations for an easy to understand visualization. The file uses a combination of Mapbox, D3, USGS JSON data, and 2002 tectonic boundary data from [flaxen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json).

For an example of what the map looks like, see the image below:
